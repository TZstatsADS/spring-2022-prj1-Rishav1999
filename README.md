## Project 1: A "data story" on the history of philosophy

### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: The Philosophy Data Project
+ This project is conducted by Rishav Agarwal

+ Project summary: [a short summary] Philosophy is the fundamental knowledge of the entire existence. How and what we perceive is philosophy. The History of Philosophy Dataset contains more than over 300,000 sentences from over 50 texts spanning 10 major schools of philosophy. The represented schools are: Plato, Aristotle, Rationalism, Empiricism, German Idealism, Communism, Capitalism, Phenomenology, Continental Philosophy, and Analytic Philosophy. Analyzing this dataset is analyzing the greatest minds of history who's philosophies are still relevant in the current times, who's philosphies have shaped the current times. The Project aims to answer three questions by performing an Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
