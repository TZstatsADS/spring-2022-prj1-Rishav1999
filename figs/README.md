### Figs folder

The figs directory contains the figures. This directory only contains generated files; that is, one should always be able to delete the contents and regenerate them.

- There are total 26 images / visualizations generated via the Jupyter Notebook.
- When the Jupypter Notebook cells are run the images are updated automatically, one can either delete these images to have a fresh start or let it be as the new images get overwritten.
