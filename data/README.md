### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

- The Data Folder should contain the philosophy_data.csv which is used for the analysis in the Project, but due to size issue the csv file is not present.
- It also contains the Images of 5 authors used for WordCloud masking
- It has a cover image used as the header of the HTML Blog
